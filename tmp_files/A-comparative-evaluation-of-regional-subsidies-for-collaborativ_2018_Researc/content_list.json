Adopting a counterfactual approach to policy evaluation, we compare subsidies for collaborative R&D and for individual R&D implemented in the same Italian region in the same period. Our findings suggest that, once public support is no longer available, the two subsidies have different effects on different types of SMEs. If the policymakers' objective is to increase the number of R&D-performing SMEs over time, they should provide subsidies for collaborative R&D to firms with modest R&D experience. If their objective is to increase the amount of spontaneous R&D investment over time, they should target SMEs with some prior R&D experience, using either subsidy. Finally, if their objective is to induce SMEs to network with external organisations, subsidies for collaborative R&D projects should be preferred to subsidies for individual R&D projects. ",

In countries with multilevel policy frameworks, such policies are more likely to be implemented at the regional level (Blanes and Busom, 2004), where interventions often pursue local development objectives. As a consequence, many regional innovation policies aim not only to support the R&D efforts of the most dynamic SMEs, but also to expand the range of SMEs that perform some amount of R&D. This dual objective is typical of lagging economies as well as of more advanced ones: even in the latter, in fact, many SMEs do not innovate at all and, among those that do, many engage in forms of innovation that are not necessarily based on R&D (Som 2012).

We focus on subsidies and, in particular, on two distinct approaches to delivering them. On the one hand, policymakers can provide SMEs with subsidies for individual R&D projects, in order to overcome the financial hurdles that prevent them from engaging in R &D activities or limit the amount of their R&D investment. Until recently, this is by far the most common approach. On the other hand, policymakers can grant subsidies to SMEs that perform collaborative R &D projects with external organisations (such as universities, public bodies, other firms or others), a more complex form of support that mixes financial and behavioural incentives. Besides providing financial support, these policies stimulate SMEs to internalise spillovers, pool resources and share costs (Hagedoorn et al., 200o). By encouraging collaboration, policymakers aim to address network failures that can occur whenever firms' lack of linkages with other organisations leads to an insufficient development of complementarities, learning processes, and creation of new ideas, or when firms are trapped in relational and knowledge lock-ins (Carlsson and Jacobsson, 1997; Hagedoorn et al., 2000; Hekkert and Negro, 2009). This can be particularly important for SMEs, which are often constrained by limited internal resources (Nootebo0m, 1994). ",

In particular, we analyse whether subsidies for SMEs to perform collaborative R&D projects are more or less able than subsidies for SMEs’ individual R&D projects to stimulate R&D and networking effects after the subsidised project is completed. The term ‘R&D effects'refers to the increase in R& D investment induced by the receipt of public aid (David and Hall, 2000). From a social viewpoint, this can be achieved both through an increase in R&D investment by all firms, including those that were already R&D performers, and through an increase in the number of R&D performers (Gonzalez et al., 2005; Arqué-Castells and Mohnen, 2015; Garza et al., 2015). In what follows we will consider both aspects. The network effects - which is part of the broader notion of behavioural additionality (Buisseret et al., 1995; Autio et al., 2008) - refers to the increase in collaborations with external organisations induced by the receipt of public aid (Georghiou and Clarysse, 2006; Falk, 2007; Busom and Fernandez-Ribas, 2008).

Section 3 describes in some detail the empirical object of the analysis: two different policy interventions - one being a subsidy for collaborative R&D projects and the other a subsidy for individual R&D projects. Both interventions were implemented in the same region (Tuscany, Italy), in the same programming period (2000-2006), by the same public authority (the regional government), and targeted the same types of beneficiaries (SMEs). Section 4 presents data and variables, and Section 5 explains our empirical strategy, which uses a matching approach applied to the case of multiple treatments, as proposed by Lechner (2002a, 2002b). So far, this approach has not been adopted in relation to enterprise and innovation policies. Sections 6 and 7 present and discuss the results.

Arqué-Castells and Mohnen (2015) suggest that R&D subsidies can stimulate the increase in R&D over one or the other margin depending on their size. Subsidies that are large enough to cover the cost of initiating R&D activities (i.e. the entry threshold, which is rather high due to the presence of sunk costs) can affect the extensive margin, while subsidies above the continuation threshold - which is lower than the entry threshold - can affect the intensivemargin.

Instead, subsidies are more attractive for financially-constrained firms such as SMEs and suited to encourage both R&D entry and higher R&D investment. ",

In our study, we investigate the effects of the programmes on firms' later R&D behaviour, in a time where public aid is no longer available. At this time, the main effect that can be investigated is R&D persistence: the extent to which firms that received the subsidy continue to perform R&D. In this context, the definition of extensive and intensive margin put forward by the previous literature needs to be adjusted: one might view persistence effects as a matter of higher probability of performing R&D (extensive margin), or as a matter of higher R&D investment (intensive margin) during the unsubsidised follow-up period. As we will explain in what follows, this distinction is relevant because we argue that the two policies we focus on can have different effects on the different margins. ",

        "text": "There are a number of reasons for focusing on R&D persistence, particularly when analysing SMEs. It is known that SMEs tend to carry out, if any, informal R&D activities (Kleinknecht and Reijnen, 1991), often in an intermittent and semi-structured way (Rammer et al., 2009). This approach limits the accumulation of internal R&D skills over time, increasing SMEs' dependence on the inflows of external knowledge and know-how, which are subject to search, screening and other transaction costs (Fontana et al., 2006), and may ultimately result in discontinuous R&D practice (Rammer et al., 2009). The presence of persistence effects suggests that a policy has been able to encourage SMEs to engage in R& D more continuously, independently from future subsidisation programmes. As argued by Klette and Moen (2012), positive effects may be expected to arise after a time lag has passed due to the fact that the implementation of the subsidised project can induce learning-by-doing in R&D activities, and thus change the firms' future profit opportunities in favour of more R&D-intensive products.

Thanks to experiential learning processes, employees and managers can develop new or improved skills and increase their capacity to interpret different aspects of the creative process, which can drive change in company routines (Cyert and March, 1963; Clarysse et al., 2009). Moreover, during the project's development, the firm can build or acquire some innovation infrastructures or equipment, which can be used in future innovation projects. Once the subsidised project is over, new and improved knowledge, skills, capabilities, routines, and, possibly, equipment and infrastructures, improve the value of the firm's future innovation projects and therefore can increase the probability that it will continue to invest in R&D with its own funds (Clarysse et al., 2009; Roper and Hewitt-Dundas, 2014). The increase in absorptive capacity that results from new and improved skills can strengthen this effect (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989). As investing in R&D has become less costly, the SME can even decide to increase the amount invested. However, the effect on the amount invested is more uncertain because, for example, there could be an“optimal\" project dimension that the SME, even for organizational or cognitive reasons, can manage (Bocci and Mariani, 2015).

An important prerequisite for triggering interorganisational learning processes is that the firm has internal skills, capabilities, routines and governance systems that allow orfacilitatecollaborativework with external organisations (Dyer and Singh, 1998), which is not always the case in SMEs (Nooteboom, 1994; Van Gils and Zwart, 2004; Teirlinck and Spithoven, 2013). These knowledge and skills are difficult to learn, because their partly uncodified nature can hamper their diffusion to third parties (Polanyi, 1966; Howells, 1996; Kale et al., 2000). The collaborative work that develops during the subsidised project can instead facilitate such diffusion, as far as it facilitates the development of interorganisational trust (Dodgson, 1992, 1993). Public funding can support either the experimentation with brand-new collaborative practices or the fine-tuning of existing ones, which can be used in future activities. After the end of the subsidised project, the firm will find it more useful and less costly to collaborate with external organisations. This is particularly important in environments where collaboration is crucial for competitiveness (Baldwin and Clark, 2000; Chesbrough et al., 2006), and particularly for SMEs, which can rely on relatively scarce internal resources and competencies (Narula, 2004; Laursen and Salter, 2006; Lee et al., 2010).An SME that has learned how to collaborate with external partners knows how to access and manage the different pieces of knowledge and skills that are needed to carry out an R&D project (Van de Vrande et al., 2009) and therefore will be more likely to continue to perform R&D activities.

Although this knowledge and information are not of primary importance for R&D, they can facilitate the development of such activities in SMEs, which have a relatively small human capital pool, few managers and little resources to be invested in searching and screening of the external context (Vossen, 1998).

SMEs and public research organisations in fact are characterised by different cultures and languages (Bruneel et al., 2010; Lockett and Wright, 2005; Sauermann and Stephan, 2013; Russo and Rossi, 2009), approaches to innovation (Barnes et al., 2002), and research orientation (Petruzzelli and Rotolo, 2015).

It implemented both classical subsidies to individual R &D projects, as well as subsidies for collaborative R&D projects, the latter inspired by the Regional Innovation System framework which has gained popularity since the late 1990s (Cooke et al., 1997; Russo and Rossi, 2009). Both policies were designed and implemented by the same policymaker, in the same time frame and with the same funds, and aimed to support relatively small R&D projects carried out by SMEs. The similarity between the ultimate objectives of the two programmes was apparent from the official programming documents and calls for applications, and was confirmed by the policymakers we interviewed.2 Both programmes resorted to the same instrument: an R&D subsidy delivered under the de minimis clause.? However, one policy provided subsidies for individual firms to perform their own R&D projects, while the other subsidised projects carried out by temporary consortia or associations between SMEs and other organisations, such as universities, research centres, or innovation intermediaries (Howells, 2006; Russo and Rossi, 2009). The latter intervention was premised on the assumption that the inclusion of these supposedly more knowledgeable organisations would mainly benefit participating SMEs. Therefore, it makes sense to evaluate the impact of the policy on SMEs, rather than on the other participants. Almost all the participants in the R&D collaboration policy were regional organisations.

The propensity score is a univariate summary of the information contained in the vector of pre-treatment covariates. For each pair of treatments l and $m_{\\mathrm{:}}$ . the propensity score is defined as $e_{i}^{l,m}\\!=\\!P r(T_{i}=l|X_{i},\\operatorname{T}=l,m)$ This summary has two important properties (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983): (i) it is a balancing score, in the sense that it theoretically guarantees that observations with the same value of the propensity score have the same distribution of observable characteristics independently of the treatment; (i) if treatment assignment is strongly ignorable given $\\pmb{X}_{i},$ then it is also strongly ignorable given the propensity score. The two properties together make it possible to match firms from different treatment groups using this univariate summary instead of the original covariates. In order to facilitate the estimation of a propensity score that satisfies the previous property (i), Imai and Ratkovic (2014) have recently proposed a generalisedmethod-of-moments estimator of the propensity score where a single model determines both the conditional probability of treatment assignment and optimised covariate balancing weights. A key advantage of this methodology is that it mitigates the harm deriving from a potential misspecification of a parametric propensity score, because the coefficients of the propensity score model are estimated maximising the covariate balance. Therefore, we resort to this powerful covariate-balancing propensity score (CBPS) estimator in our study. The covariates we insert in the CBPS models, one for each pair of treatment groups, are all the background characteristics defined in Table 1. They include the pre-treatment values of all outcome variables (including the deflated value of R&D investment), a categorical variable for the sector of the firm, a categorical variable for firm size, a dummy for the firm's legal form and a categorical variable for the province in which the firm is located. The coefficients of the propensity score models are reported in Table A1 in the Appendix. After having ascertained that the estimated CBPSs always guarantee that the overlap assumption is satisfied in practice, we evaluate to which extent they also imply a satisfactory covariate balance. Following Imbens and Rubin (2015) and the previous methodological field literature, we perform this assesment by looking at normalised mean differences before and after conditioning on the estimated propensity scores (Table A2 in the Appendix). Such conditioning may take place by using propensity-score-based balancing weights (Imai and Ratkovic, 2014). With respect to the unconditional contrast between the mean level of pre-treatment covariates in each pair of treatment groups, once we condition on the estimated CBPSs we have considerable improvements in covariate balance. This notwithstanding, small differences persist in some of the pre-treatment values of outcome variables. We choose to address these residual differences in the pre-treatment values of all outcomes using the bias-corrected matching estimator by Abadie and Imbens (2011) that combines nearest-neighbour matching (based, in our case, on the propensity score as distance metric) with a correction factor calculated using a regression model for the outcome variable in the group of matched controls.10,11 ",

If the policymakers’ aim was to expand in a non-transitory way the number of SMEs that perform R&D - i.e. to induce an improvement in the spontaneous extensive margin over time - they could target firms with modest R&D experience through an R&D collaboration policy, rather than implement an individual R&D subsidy which would likely attract firms that are already performing internal R&D and will continue to do so also when the subsidy is no longer there. Obviously, targeting can be difficult to do in practice. However, innovation intermediaries (Howells, 2006; Russo et al., 2016) that - in some sectors, technologies or territories - map the characteristics of firms and their skills could provide support in this activity.

This suggests that SMEs that are already R&D performers may benefit more from the relief of financing constraints, rather than from the interorganisational learning triggered by R&D collaboration. ",

By comparing two different types of R &D policies that used the same instrument (a subsidy), but promoted different activities (in-house R&D investments vs collaborative R&D), we found that the policy supporting collaborative R&D was able to stimulate a change in firms’ behaviour both towards R&D investment and networking, but these different effects were likely to occur in different groups of firms. SMEs that, prior to policy participation, were less likely to collaborate with external organisations were those that could see, in an unsubsidised future, their propensity to networking improved by the participation in a policy supporting collaborative R&D. SMEs that, prior to policy participation, were less likely to perform internal R &D activities were those that could see, in an unsubsidised future, their propensity to perform some R&D improved by receiving a subsidy for collaborative R&D, thus raising the proportion of R&D-performing SMEs in the economy.
