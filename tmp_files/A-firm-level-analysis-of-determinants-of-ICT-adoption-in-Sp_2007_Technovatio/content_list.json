In order to achieve this goal, the data collected in a survey with a sample of 337 Spanish workplaces are used. The paper overcomes some of the limitations found in the empirical literature since it examines several ICT infrastructure and usage indicators at the same time, using a sample of workplaces of different sizes in all activity sectors in a context of a developed country with a low rate of ICT incidence. Results highlight the need to study the different ICT separately as well as the importance of establishment size, multinational ownership, and high-skilled workforce in ICT adoption. Quality control systems and team-based organization of work also play a relevant role in the diffusion of certain elements of ICT within firms. The need of reviewing the traditional public support for ICT implementation on small workplaces arises, together with the existence of complementarities with policies aimed to attract foreign investments and to increase the workforce education level as a way to spread ICT implementation. Results also show that managers need to align ICT adoption and the strategic focus of the firm more consistently. $\\copyright$ 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ",

ICT are enabling firm reorganization and major changes to be made in all the firm's functional areas (Falk, 2005). ICT adoption has drastically modified communication, sales, and information methods (Lapierre and Denier, 2005; Wang et al., 2006), thus enabling firms to achieve strong competitive advantage, in both production and other areas. ICT also helps companies to increase their potential for competitive advantage by enabling them to perform primary and support activities either at less cost or in a way that leads to differentiation and a premium price (Porter and Millar, 1985).

Knowledge about the relationship between ICT and firm characteristics, firm strategies, and the competitive environment can help firms to obtain greater benefits from ICT adoption. There is no doubt about the fact that, to obtain such benefits, it is absolutely essential to identify the variables that affect the decision of firms to adopt ICT. This concern has led in the last years to several studies analysing the drivers of ICT adoption and usage (Dubelaar et al., 2005; Ferneley and Bell, 2006; Lefebvre et al., 2005; Lucchetti and Sterlacchini, 2004; Mahmood et al., 2001; Soliman and Janz, 2004; Teo and Ranganathan, 2004; Zhu et al.,2003).

The opportunity to exert market power is assumed to provide the potential innovator with the incentive to undertake the investments required by the innovation. Intense rivalry between firms also prompts them to keep a watch on one another's competitive moves, which makes them relatively quick to accept technological innovations (Gattignon and Robertson, 1989).

Therefore, firms facing more intense competition in the market tend to attach more value to ICT innovations, which are seen nowadays as a requisite to compete in the marketplace (Premkumar and Ramamurthy, 1995).

Multinational ownership also increases the probability of integration in a broader internal network, increasing the need for ICT adoption (Galliano et al., 2001).

For example, ICT-uptake such as PCs, Internet access, and e-mail accounts per employee, and ICT use measured by the percentage of employees that are computer or e-mail users, are negatively related to the number of employees in a workplace.
