Results show that innovation increases the probability of survival, although the impact on firm survival is conditioned by the timing of the innovation, the characteristics associated with the innovation strategy, along with the level of risk embodied in the innovation process. Cautious innovators are found to survive longer and contribute to a higher social welfare via gains in firm efficiency. In contrast, risky innovators are less likely to survive, are less efficient, and are only sometimes compensated for their risk in terms of higher profits. Results therefore show that other factors besides higher payoffs force some firms to engage in riskier innovation strategies. ",

This result confirms the finding in Zhang and Mohnen (2013). More diversification risk tends to generate higher profits, but come at the expense of efficiency. Innovative firms with higher diversification risk are therefore,found to be only partially compensated for their higher survival risk. The positive and statistically significant coefficient in Column (6), on the other hand,reveals that innovativefirms withlower diversification risk enjoy a larger efficiency gain. ",

In contrast, more risky innovators are less likely to survive, are less efficient, and are only sometimes compensated for their risk in terms of higher profits. A similar relationship between innovation risk and firm performance is also found in the case of Chile (Fernandes and Paunov, 2014), providing some confirmation that factors other than higher payoffs force some firms in transitioning economies to engage in riskierinnovationstrategies.Common factors include market failures, asymmetric information, bankruptcy risks and agency conflicts.
