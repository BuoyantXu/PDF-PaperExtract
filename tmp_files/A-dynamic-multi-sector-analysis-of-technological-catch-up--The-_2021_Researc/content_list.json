Recent work on sectoral systems of innovation and in the evolutionary economics literature suggests that successful latecomers can move into new technological or industrial domains. They specialise in domains that present more frequent windows of opportunity, shorter technological cycles, flatter learning curves and easier access to relevant knowledge than others. This study investigates the role and significance of two hitherto neglected dimensions of technological regimes that might influence technological catch-up, namely, the degree of complexity and variety of an industry's knowledge base.

Other empirical studies have centred on cross-country catch-up, examining the interplay between firm strategies, capabilities and national framework conditions (Lee and Yoon, 2010; Miao et al., 2018). Yet other studies focused on the distinctive features of industrial sectors, addressing disparities in terms of available resources, industry structures and knowledge bases (Malerba and Mani, 2009; Malerba and Nelson, 2011). Lee and Malerba (2017, 2018) propose a cycle of economic catch-up whereby latecomers enter and successfully compete in an industrial sector and, subsequently, are able to build innovation capacity. This can be achieved in market niches in which, given the sectoral conditions, they enjoy a comparative advantage, at a distance from the technological frontier. However, when positions within value chains are upgraded, innovation capacity can also be built and extended (Lee, 2013). Consequently, if windows of opportunity open, such as a new technological paradigm or a business cycle downturn that threatens incumbents (Lee et al., 2014), latecomers can exploit them. ",

When discontinuities at the SSI level emerge, latecomers with a certain degree of innovation capacity can attempt to displace existing leaders or diversify into new domains. At a country level, catch-up is uneven across different industries as they entail different conditions to succeed. In particular, the characteristics of an industry's knowledge base help to determine which conduits, if any, are available to access the technological knowledge needed to build innovation capacity. Multinational companies (MNCs) are seen as a possible channel for knowledge transfer. Athreye and Cantwell (2007) highlight their internationally networked structures, whereas other authors argue that global production networks can lead to knowledge transfer (Ernst and Kim, 2002) in favour of new players (Saxenian, 2004), triggering catch-up ",

On the contrary, where large stocks of knowledge are tacit and cumulative, they are problematic to absorb through global networks (Park and Lee, 2006; Mani and Malerba, 2009). Moreover, the closer one gets to the technological frontier, the more difficult it becomes to understand, transform, and implement relevant knowledge (Criscuolo and Narula, 2008; Hu and Mathews, 2005). Intellectual property rights protect advanced codified knowledge, preventing access or making it costly (Jung and Lee, 2010).

The speed and extent to which catching-up countries can access and absorb relevant knowledge will depend on the interplay amongst their existing innovation capacities, the available learning channels and the sector-specific barriers to learning they encounter along the way (Breschi and Malerba, 1997; Lee, 2013.2019).

(2000) and Malerba (2005) built on this and extended it to further dimensions of the SSI's knowledge base: cumulativeness; generic vs. specific nature with respect to industrial activities; and complexity as defined by two properties: (i) the mix of scientific and applied knowledge and (ii) degree of variety among the functional competences held by industrial firms, such as R&D, engineering or manufacturing.

The length of a technological cycle reflects the speed at which technological knowledge becomes obsolete. Being at the front of the technological frontier in SSIs characterised by short cycles can be a short-lived advantage, as new windows of opportunity frequently open. Sectoral domains such as mobile phones, information technologies and semiconductors have these characteristics (Park and Lee, 2006; Lee et al., 2014; Han and Niosi, 2018). The tacit vs. codified nature of the knowledge embodied in new products and services has also been studied. For instance, the pharmaceutical industry is pervaded by codified knowledge which should be easier to access even at a distance. However, its knowledge base is also shaped by long cycles and strong property rights, which hinders catch-up (Malerba and Orsenigo, 2015). Conversely, in wind power the shortening of technological cycles has not yet triggered catch-up due to the high specificity of knowledge and the complexity of the current product architecture (Lema et al., 2020; Dai et al.,2020).

However, when the expanding knowledge base of an industry is harder to access, decompose and transfer, it has been more difficult to absorb it either locally (Lema and Lema, 2012; Han and Niosi, 2018) or over global networks (Lee and Jung, 2010; Gosens et al., 2017, Binz et al., 2020).

First, if the variety of a knowledge base increases, a wider range of technological classes contributes to its evolution. Second, if the degree of interdependency between these classes increases, then changes in one component of the knowledge system can impact various other components of the same system (Antonelli, 2011). Thus, access to systemic knowledge is often required (Saviotti, 2011; Huenteler et al., 2016) and diffusion of knowledge over long distances is more challenging, requiring recipients with high absorptive capacity (Sorenson et al., 2006: Krafft et al., 2011: Petralia et al., 2017).

Greater complexity makes access to knowledge more difficult and dynamic coordination failures more likely to occur, requiring individual actors to be able to absorb as well as integrate interdependent bits of knowledge (Park, 2013) to innovate. Latecomers will find it more challenging to develop the learning channels and innovation ecosystems required to build their innovation capacity (Maleki and Rosiello, 2019) and exploit emerging windows of opportunity. By contrast, in the case of technological regimes whose knowledge bases have a less complex and more modular structure, we expect technology transfer to be easier and catch-up to occur more readily (Lee, 2019).

Especially in industries where technological change is path-dependent, countries with less capacity will find it more difficult to develop the innovation capacity required to diversity into new domains (Mealy and Teytelboym, 2020). In these conditions, greater variety can slow catch-up by hindering the opening of new opportunities for leapfrogging and diversification.

Its supply chain features multiple players, some of whom are vertically integrated, and others who concentrate on particular sub-segments, such as supply and service companies. In terms of innovation patterns, in the 1990s a new class of innovators - integrated service companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton - emerged (Beyazay-Odemis, 2016) that can cope with increased knowledge base complexity (Maleki et al., 2018).

Wind turbines are electro-mechanical devices that consist of a multitude of components. The design or physical characteristics of a turbine can often be adapted to the characteristics of the wind-farm site. A principal distinction is between onshore and offshore sites, but average wind speed, characteristics of the terrain and climate, and altitude of the site can also play a key role. The high number of moving components is reflected in very high costs of transportation, operation and maintenance. Production, construction and installation activities are organised as standard industrial processes that involve skilled manual labour and are executed using multi-purpose equipment. Specialist equipment can be employed in the blade manufacturing and installation processes (large moulds and cranes). A restricted number of Original Brand Manufacturers (OBMs) install wind-blades both offshore and onshore, dominating the global value chain. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) also play a significant role: some European OEMs have design capabilities, whereas the design and innovation capacity of OEMs in emerging markets remains limited (Awate et al., 2012; Schmitz and ",

The photovoltaic industry value chain features three segments: 1) upstream - polysilicon materials and wafer production; 2) mid-stream - solar cells and PV module production; and 3) downstream - PV system and installation. PV/solar systems are small and relatively standardised artefacts combined with mounting and tracking structures, plus inverters and control systems, to transfer electricity to the grid (Huenteler et al., 2016). Their product architecture is not complex. They comprise only a few moving parts, which implies lower transportation and maintenance costs. Solar cells are produced in batches of thousands on long, specialised, automated production lines, which require high capital expenditures.

Whilst from a technical standpoint specialised design and engineering capabilities have become necessary to address the heterogeneity of local conditions, distinct regulatory and policy frameworks have proliferated in each industry. In upstream oil/gas, the trend of redistribution of innovative activities can be described as a situation in which ‘exploration and production activities are best conceptualized as hollow or networked projects' (Bridge, 2008, p. 400). However, the spatiality of the global production network is shaped by the complex interplay between the geographical localization of knowledge-intensive activities and the concurrent delocalization of extractive ones (Maleki and Rosiello, 2019).

Nevertheless, they are commonly used as indicators of a country's (Griliches, 1998) or a firm's (Gittelman, 2008) innovation efforts. The international business, SSI and economic geography literatures use information about inventors to investigate R&D processes and retrace knowledge flows. In addition, patent citations are frequently employed as proxies for R&D outputs or innovation performance. Unlike a simple counting of patents, patent citations can reflect a patent's quality, as they predict its prominence in an industry's knowledge base. The catch-up literature has extensively used both patent counts and citations to trace knowledge flows (Hu and Jaffe, 2003; Lee and Yoon 2010), investigate catch-up strategies (Hu and Mathews, 2005) and to study the impact of technological regimes on catch-up (Park and Lee, 2006).

In sectors with high levels of such complexity, new knowledge production depends on the identification and consolidation of complementary components.

When nodes are formed faster than links are made, the network becomes less connected and complex. Conversely, when the formation of new connections is faster than the appearance of new nodes in the knowledge network, the connectivity and the complexity of the knowledge network increase. ",

This signifies a wave of new technologies being introduced into these industries, for which the existing cognitive bases are essential in terms of their generation and use. The trends of unrelated variety (Figure 2b) present a similar evolution, albeit remarkably different in terms of intensity. In oil/gas, expansion of the search space ends in the mid-1980s. After that, the trend becomes negative, confirming the industry had matured with respect to the range of technological classes it relies upon. By contrast, wind power and PV/solar display a sustained upward trend, showing their continued expansion into domains unconnected with their current technological bases. ",

Until 2012, systemic complexity remained higher than in PV/solar and upstream oil/gas (Figure 3); OBMs in advanced countries have maintained control over systemic patents that are connected with other sub-systems within the industry's knowledge base (Huenteler et al., 2016).

Despite the different trends of knowledge base complexity and related variety in the three sectors, both are shown to exert a significant influence on catch-up dynamics (Table 7). Such a result holds, despite the structural differences among the three knowledge systems and their distinct evolutionary trajectories. First, this confirms our first research hypothesis (Section 2.2) by providing the novel insight that complex interactions between technology classes in the context of an expanding knowledge base can hinder the catch-up process. When the technological frontier moves faster, catch-up in the presence of high technological complexity could be problematic. Second, the concurrent significance of related variety and cumulativeness shows they can also form strong barriers to catch-up, evoking path dependence in the evolution of the knowledge base. Catch-up is harder in industries where technological change builds on innovations closely related to existing classes, which confirms our second hypothesis, or innovators persist in registering patents within the same technological domains (Park and Lee, 2006: Petralia et al., 2017: Lee and Malerba, 2018).

Indeed, although we generally observe an increasing openness of the appropriability regimes, the degree of appropriability is negatively correlated with technological catch-up. Our findings are less straightforward with regard to technology cycle times. In PV/solar and oil/gas they confirm Park and Lee's (2006) and Lee's (2013, 2019) theory that shorter cycles favour catch-up. Results of the econometric analysis in wind power, however, point in the opposite direction. Here, the shortening of technological cycles initiated in 1990 did not trigger technological catch-up, as the latter occurred only until 1994 (Figure 10). Such a result provides interesting empirical evidence to challenge the assumption that faster change in technological knowledge promotes the building up of innovation capacity by latecomers. ",

Our results capture these cross-sectoral variations and specificity, whereas previous empirical analysis helps us explain the origins of such heterogeneity. In upstream oil/gas, up to the late 1990s inventive activities became increasingly spread as the geographic scope of the search for new reservoirs expanded, and new innovators emerged, such as Norway, Brazil, Russia, and Saudi Arabia (Figure 9; Tables 2,3). However, since the early 1990s, a prolonged period of low prices (which extended until the mid-2000s) coincided with the progressive exhaustion of easily accessible reservoirs. Innovative solutions around upstream operations had to be found (Hassani et al., 2017). Integrated service companies invested heavily to develop ‘highly specialized design and engineering capabilities to develop technological solutions capable of addressing the heterogeneity of exploration conditions and reservoir types’ (Bridge, 2008, p. 407). Consequently, while catch-up from the early 1980s had been the result of R&D internationalisation by ‘Oil Majors’ and the creation of state-owned MNCs with R&D capacity such Statoil, Petrobras or Rosneft, the reverse trend since the late 1990s coincided with the emergence of integrated service providers (Figure 10). With HQs in developed countries, they took control of the global R&D operations emerging from an increasingly complex knowledge base (Beyazay-Odemis,2016; Berenzoy,2019). ",

Wind turbines are complex and design-intensive products, which are now integrated with other sources of renewable energy, installed offshore, and employ advanced digital technologies (Dai et al,2020). OBMs in advanced countries control systemic patents and engineering know-how that are key for their development and installation (Huenteler et al., 2016; Haakonsson and Slepniov, 2018). Similar to oil/gas, knowledge development requires user-producer interaction to adapt wind farms to the morphology of local environments, which makes it less geographically mobile. European engineering service providers help Asian OEMs to bridge the technological gap, but do not possess systemic knowledge (Haakonsson et al.,2020). ",

An increasingly varied knowledge base with weak interdependence among technological classes (Figures 2a,b and 3) has helped countries such as China, Taiwan and South Korea to catch up (Tables 2 and 3). New players have been able to intercept growth, first in global demand (Shubbak, 2019),and then in local markets (Han and Niosi, 2018). China, in particular, is a new technological leader (Table 3). In the 1990s, Chinese companies started to produce PV modules through technology acquisition from more advanced countries and favourable cost conditions. They then developed global competitiveness via vertical integration, thanks to flexibility of production and collaborations with global centres of excellence (Zhang and Gallagher 2015; Lacasa and Shubbak, 2018).

Asian firms first entered PV module manufacturing through technology acquisition, and then progressively upgraded their strategic position. They initially relied on existing knowledge bases in lateral sectors but quickly acquired vital processrelated knowledge. Tacit knowledge transfer happened via relocation of human resources and direct cooperation with international partners. By contrast, catching up in wind power requires in-depth understanding of complex systems and products and the transfer of design- or productspecific knowledge. Intra-firm channels are the dominant mode of knowledge transfer, as MNCs built capacity in foreign markets by setting up wholly owned subsidiaries. Some knowledge has been transferred via providers of engineering services, but it has not been enough to catch up. ",

First, we describe the evolution of the three industries’ technological regime and assess past catch-up trends. Second, we assess whether and to what extent the evolution of the technological regime affects the catch-up process. Our novel approach uses a data series covering a thirty-seven-year period and compares results across three industries using a multi-country perspective. We focus on two dimensions of an SSI's technological regime that relate to its knowledge base, variety and complexity, although we also consider length of technological cycle, knowledge cumulativeness, the role of the regime of appropriability and change in energy consumption globally. Following Athreye and Cantwell (2007), catch-up trends have been measured as changes in the degree of geographical concentration (or dispersal) of a country's innovation capacity associated with its patent shares, which we then aggregate at the industrylevel.

Although we employ different econometric models to study the effect of change in technological regime dimensions and demand conditions on catch-up in these industries, we find that increased knowledge base complexity and related variety represent a significant barrier to catch-up in each of them; whereas unrelated variety does not exert any significant influence. Other dimensions of technological regime can also hinder the catch-up process by reinforcing the position of technological leaders, although their significance varies depending on the industrial sector. Park and Lee's (2006) and Lee's (2013, 2019) theory that technological gaps can be reduced more quickly in sectors with shorter cycles is confirmed only in the upstream oil/gas and PV/ solar sectors; in wind power our findings point in the opposite direction. This reveals a more complex picture as compared with these theories of technological catch-up. The direction and intensity of the statistical relationship between technological catch-up and changes in some features of the learning environment can be industry specific. ",

However, we also observe increasing complexity and variety, longer technology cycle times and path dependency, which hindered catch-up (Maleki and Rosiello, 2019). PV solar, like other sectors such as biomass and hydropower, has evolved into a mature sector relying on tradable knowledge and established standards, in which technological upgrading was initially achieved through global knowledge transfer (Binz et al., 2017, 2020). Our results corroborate this theory, adding two factors that favoured catch-up: shorter technology cycle times than in the other two industries, which have been shortening since 2005; lower knowledge base complexity, decreasing across the whole period.

        "text": "In wind power, a regime of loose appropriability has coincided with a decline in technology cycle times over the entire period. However, cycle times stayed longer than in the other two industries for most of the thirty-seven-year period. In parallel, variety continued to increase and, until 2012, complexity remained higher (Hunteler et al., 2016). Specifically, the uptake of digital technologies (Dai et al.，2020） has contributed to shortening cycle times as well as increasing variety and complexity. The interplay between these variables explains why our results are at odds with Park and Lee (2006), showing that complex and varied knowledge bases can hinder catch-up even if technology cycles are shortening. This is plausible especially in sectors characterised by complex product architecture, user-producer interaction and context-specific knowledge, as technological upgrading requires more experimentation (Lema et al., 2020) and knowledge integration capacity (Park, 2013). Overall, our findings prove that studying the interaction between different dimensions of technological regime is crucial to explain catch-up dynamics (Malerba and Lee, 2020). ",

Even if advanced technologies are used in situ and adjustments to local circumstances are necessary, building capacity may be more difficult when targeting industries with complex interactions or a high level of relatedness among the technological classes forming their knowledge base. This has important implications for industrial strategy, as innovation policies and institutional changes must be efficiently timed to enable the exploitation of emerging windows of opportunity (Malerba and Lee, 2020). However, if a knowledge base is complex and context-specific and its frontier is constantly shifting, it can take longer for latecomers to build the innovation ecosystem required to skip developmental stages or to diversify into new technological domains. Research in industries other than those considered therein should be conducted before extending this conclusion. ",

As noted earlier, patents are used in the literature as indicators of technological change and performance in terms of new technologies, processes and products. However, they cannot capture all forms of innovation, and systematic biases in data are possible. For instance, they cannot be used to study the evolution and diffusion of a tacit knowledge base. Furthermore, in the three industries under consideration, it is important to observe that a significant portion of the development occurs in the field. In particular, hydrocarbon reserves or wind-farm sites have distinctive characteristics. Although new technology is conceived in the lab,adaptations to local conditions are frequently needed. Moreover, the scope of a firm's patenting strategy may differ from country to country depending on the length of time and level of protection offered by patent law, which affects an innovator's incentive to rely on patents over other forms of safeguard.
