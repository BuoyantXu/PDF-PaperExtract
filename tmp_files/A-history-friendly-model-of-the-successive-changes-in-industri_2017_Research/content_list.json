        "text": "Successive changes in industrial leadership between both firms and countries (described here as catch-up cycles) have been common in several sectors. This article develops a history-friendly model to explore the role played by technological conditions in the emergence of such leadership changes. The model is inspired by two cases where the emergence of disruptively novel technology played an important role: mobile phones and semiconductors. In the baseline setting the model is able to generate the benchmark case of three cycles with two leadership changes. In particular, the simulation analysis reveals that: (a) the more disruptive the new technology and the lower the incumbents' capabilities, the greater the shake-up of market shares between incumbents and latecomers; (b) leadership change is more likely to occur when it coincides with certain responses by the actors to the technological disruption, such as a high lock-in behaviour on the part of incumbents; and (c) a technology-driven change of industrial leadership is more likely to occur in the presence of increasing returns to technological investments. The counterfactual experiments show that different catch-up dynamics can emerge depending on the magnitude of technological disruption, the degree of lock-ins, the shape of technological landscape, and incumbents' initial capabilities. In particular, four other types of catch-up cycle are generated - the aborted cycle, persistent leadership, return of the old leadership, and coexistence in leadership between latecomers and incumbents. Each of these cycles is identified with a specific historical case of catch-up. ",

The extensive literature about this kind of change includes studies using differing levels of analysis. Some (e.g., Tushman and Anderson, 1986; Christensen, 1997) concentrate on shifts in leadership at the level of firms within national economies - in those cases focusing on advanced industrial economies. Others, in contrast, while recognising the importance of leadership change at the firm level, subordinate that dimension beneath a primary interest in shifts of leadership at the level of national economies,as in the classic studies by Gerschenkron (1962) and Abramovitz (1986), as well as Mowery and Nelson (1999).

Christensen (1997), for example, note this pattern in the history of several industries in the US, most strikingly in the hard disk drive industry where four changes in leadership occurred in only about three or four decades. This occurrence of successive inter-firm leadership changes has also been observed in cases that have simultaneously involved shifts in leadership from advanced to latecomer economies. This is evident, for example, in two cases that were especially important in inspiring the development of this article: in mobile phones where leadership shifted from the US to Europe, and then from Europe to Korea and (partly) back again to the US (Giachetti and Marchi, 2017), and in memory chips where it moved from the Us to Japan and from Japan to Korea (Shin, 2017).

In particular, we note that the emergence of novel technologies (sometimes combined with government interventions and demand shocks) played an important role in opening opportunities for leadership change in all these cases, including the studies of leadership change within industries in the advanced economies (e.g. Tushman and Anderson, 1986; Christensen, 1997). This opportunity-opening role of technological discontinuities is therefore the main focus of the present article,following the argument of Perez and Soete (1988) that radical technological discontinuities often create‘windows of opportunity' for latecomer firms and economies. We extend that core idea further in two ways. First, we envisage that the 'size' of technology-driven windows of opportunity may vary, as reflected in the magnitude of the technological discontinuity,with corresponding variability in the consequent disruption to existing markets and capabilities.Second,we envisage thatthe extent to which leadership change depends not only on the size of the technological windows of opportunity, but also on how the incumbents andlatecomersrespond to theopening of thewindows.

Moreover, his discussion is entirely about how the location of production is shifted via foreign direct investments by multinational corporations based in advanced economies.

History-friendly models are evolutionary models in which aggregate behaviours emerge out of the repeated interaction among agents. These models were used to examine the evolution of several industries, such as computers, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and memory chips (for a review, see Garavaglia, 2010). In those cases, a specific industry is the object of analysis and the actors and mechanisms that characterize that single industry are explicitly modelled. In this article we adopt a slightly different approach. Our model is not restricted to the specifics of one industry. Although it was inspired by the cases of mobile phones and memory chips, we build a simulation model that is general enough to capture the gist of catch-up cycles in more than one industry. We do this in stages. Initially, the model focuses on the commonalities that characterize the standard catch-up cycles in mobile phones and memory chips, with a specific focus on the role of technological discontinuities. Then, once the benchmark cases have been successfully generated, we rely on counterfactual theory-driven experiments to check whether the model can replicate the differing forms of catch-up cycle observed in other industries.

The first stage is the entry stage, where the latecomers start production and try to overcome initial disadvantages with respect to incumbents. The second stage is that of gradual catchingup in terms of market shares and/or productivity. The third stage is that of forging ahead based either on initial adoption and followoninnovations or onradicalinnovationsinorganizations,products, processes and/or markets.

From the cases described in this Special Issue, one can identify several relevant ones.In some cases the incumbent has managed to maintain the leadership over several waves of new generations of technology. This is the case, for instance, of the camera industry where, after the first change from Germany to Japan, Japan succeeded in maintainingitsleadership,notwithstanding the arrival of the new SLR digital camera (Kang and Song, 2017). A similar case is memory chips where the leadership has firmly remained for more than two decades in the hands of the Korean company, Samsung, once it took over in the 1990s from Japan (which had earlier toppled the US in the 1980s - see Shin, 2017). In these cases we have persistent leadership cycles. In other cases, latecomers mayjoin incumbents in a leadership position, so that we may have a coexistence of leadership, as in the case of the wine industry (Morrison and Rabellotti, 2017). There may also exist cases where incumbents are abletoregainleadershipafterpreviouslylosingittosomelatecomers, which we refer to as the return of the old leadership, as in the case of Italy in wine in the first decade of the 2oo0s (Morrison and Rabellotti, 2017). Finally, there can be cases of aborted catchup, where the catching-up effort fails to generate a forging ahead but stays stuck at the stage of gradual catch-up. Actually, many late entrant countries fall into this category of aborted catch-up: the critical barrier against the forging-ahead stage is the capability to upgradeintohighervalue-added products. ",

The literature, in particular, suggests that different types of windows of opportunity for catch-up may open during the evolution of an industry (Lee and Malerba, 2017): they include major innovations or drastic technological change (Perez and Soete,1988), changes in market demand and consumer preferences and business cycles (Mathews, 2005), and changes in institutions and public policy (Guennif and Ramani, 2012; Chang 2002). In addition, companies and national or sectoral systems may respond in different ways to windows of opportunities depending on whether they are the existing leaders or the challengers: responsesinclude variousformsof‘incumbent traps'orotherlockin behaviour (Chandy and Tellis, 2000; Henderson and Clark, 1990) and exploiting latecomer advantages. For a more general discussion not related to catching-up, see Tushman and Anderson (1986), Christensen (1997,2002） Adner (2002） and Adner and Zemsky (2006).2 As we will show in our model, the combination of windows of opportunity and the responses by both incumbents and latecomers can explainwhichpattern of catch-up ismost likely to emerge.

Motorola was the company that actually invented the analogue-based cell phone and thus created the sector. During the early 1990s, however, the introduction of the GSM digital standard by EU and US regulators created a technological discontinuity, which enabled the production and commercialization of a new generation of digital mobile phones. While Nokia was quick to switch to this new generation, Motorola stayed too long with the old one.As a result, Nokia took over from Motorola and became the new market leader. Such leadership,however, did not last for long. In the second half of 1990s and early 2o00s, a new series of innovations associated with developments in wireless data communication (e.g. Wi-Fi) and web 2.0, as well as the improvement of multi-touch technologies, enabled a new type of mobile phone to be designed and produced: the so-called “smartphone\". Most of these innovations took place outside of the mobile phone industry and created a discontinuity that mobile phone vendors could exploit. While Nokia was relatively slow to move to the new paradigm and eventually fell behind, other companies such as Samsung and Apple were comparatively fast. As a result, a further change of industrial leadership occurred with Samsung and Apple becoming the new leaders. The overall pattern of catch-up was therefore characterized by two successive changes in leadership: first, from the US to Finland, and then from Finland toKorea and (partly)theUS(Giachetti and Marchi,2017).

In this case also, frequent changes in technology (i.e.new sizes of chips and silicon wafers) served as windows of opportunity for latecomers. In particular, the industry experienced two successive leadership changes: initially, from the US to Japan, and then from Japan to Korea. Frequent shifts in the generations of technologies (from 1 K to 16 K, 64 K, and 128 K bit memory chips), played an important role in these changes, as the latecomers often made aggressive investments in next generation technologies to wrest the leadership away from the incumbents: this can be termed ‘dynamic catch-up' (Shin, 2017) or a ‘stage-skipping' strategy (Lee and Lim, 2001). These changes were also favoured by the presence of technological discontinuities in the production of silicon wafers, the size of which increased from 3 to 5-inches and then from 6 to 8-inches. A larger size of wafers brings about significant productivity increases, but it requires memory chip producers to confront high uncertainty in technologies and market demand. While industry leaders proved not to be ready to take such risk, latecomers successfully exploited the discontinuities and obtained important increases in competitiveness. In contrast, the most recent case of Samsung continuing to keep the leadership in memory chips since thelate 1990scanbeexplained by the narrowing of the window: the new technology (flash memory) replacing the DRAMs is competence-enhancing in the sense that the existing manufacturing facilities in DRAM do not have to be scrapped but can be used to produce flash memories (Shin, 2017).

Within a given paradigm, R&D activities carried out by firms are the main drivers of innovation (Freeman, 1974; Pavitt and Wald, 1971; Pavitt and Soete,1980).A change of paradigm is modelled as a shift of the technological frontier, which enables new (and superior) technological alternatives to be pursued. Firms face the opportunity to exploit these alternatives and follow a new technological trajectory. The extent to which this will happen is endogenously determined by the firms' decisions and depends on several factors,such as firm-level capabilities,the'competence destroying' effect of the discontinuity, the lock-in effects associated with the old paradigm, and the sector-specific shape of the technology landscape.

The simulation analysis with (counterfactual) experiments has shown that the more disruptive is the new technology, the greater is the shake-up of market shares between the incumbents and latecomers. In our model, a more disruptive technology is captured by a large shift of the technological frontier. The model also shows that a leadership change is more likely to occur when it coincides with particular types of response by the actors, such as a high lock-in behaviour on the part of incumbents. The possibility of leadership change is also offered by the combination of large discontinuities with increasing returns to technological investments, which implies that in high-tech sectors technology-based windows are more effective drivers of catch-up andleadership change thanin traditional sectors.Alloftheseresults are consistent with the appreciative theory of catch-up cycles.

In particular, five distinct types of catch-up cycles have been generated. First, three standard cycles with clear leadership changes, which are our benchmark cases of mobile phones and semiconductors. Second, an aborted cycle of catch-up with only a limited rise in the market shares of latecomers,which is the most common pattern among late entrants: in our model such a case is associated with windows of limited size, which do not allow the latecomers to gain momentum and reach the leaders (see in particular Panel II of Fig. 6). Third, a case of persistent leadershipwhere theincumbent maintains theleadership.This can be related to the case of the Japanese firms Canon in the camera industry (Kang and Song, 2017) or the Korean firm Samsung in memory chips. (Shin, 2017). In our model, the persistence of leadership is given by the presence of relatively low technological lock-in so that incumbents respond rapidly to the discontinuities (see Fig. 8). Fourth, a return of the old leadership, which corresponds to the case of wine in the 2000s (Morrison and Rabellotti, 2017). In our model the return of the old leader results from an increase in the incumbent capabilities, which can be associated with the strengthening of national systems of innovation (see Fig. 14). Finally, a coexistence ofleadershipbetweenlatecomers andincumbents,which is also represented by the case of wine (Morrison and Rabellotti, 2017). In our model, coexistence is obtained by combining a concave technical landscape (that introduces decreasing returns to technologicalinvestments)withdiscontinuities ofrelatively small size (see Fig. 11).

In particular, it sheds light on technologyrelated aspects of late industrialization that contrast sharply with the aspects that have been the main focus of several previous studies. Instead of concentrating on the initial entry into industries that are new to the latecomer economy, the article explores the longterm path of subsequent developments of industries over several decades. During this long period these latecomer industries may, or may not, forge ahead to join, or eventually overtake, the global industry leaders. Although initial entry in new industries is indeed important for the dynamism of the economy, the real impact on growth and structural change of latecomer countries often comes from thoseindustries that over several decades move beyond the early start-up phase and are able to forge ahead in later stages of catch-up. Thus a key contribution of the article is to provide new insights on those technological and capability factors that favour (or limit) the transition from an initial start-up to the forging ahead stage and that eventuallylead to therepetition of this cycle again during the subsequent evolution of an industrv.

Similarly, additional responses by latecomers, such as stage-skipping or path-creating strategies, can be considered. Another route is to make the technological windows responsive to the efforts of either the latecomers or the incumbents. As discussed above, in the cases of mobile phones and memory chips technological discontinuities emerged either as a consequence of institutional change andgovernmentinterventionsor astheresult ofinnovation activities undertaken in other sectors of the economy. However, in other contexts incumbents and/or latecomers may have an active role in the creation of the discontinuity. This may have an impact on the overall catch-up dynamics. ",
