This research addresses differences in men's and women's collaborative positioning and collaborator characteristics in science, and whether network influences on scientists’ future productivity may be contingent on gender. Utilizing co-inventor network relations that span thirty years of global life science patenting across sectors, geographic locations, and technological background, I present trends of men's and women's involvement in patenting and their collaborative characteristics across time. Amidst some network similarities, women are less likely to connect otherwise unconnected inventors (brokerage) and have greater status-asymmetries between themselves and their co-inventors. In multivariate models that include past and future activity, I find that some network benefits are contingent on gender. Men receive greater returns from network positioning for brokerage ties, and when collaborating with men. Women benefit from collaborating with women, and are more likely to collaborate with women, but both men and women collaborate with mostly men. I discuss the implications of these results for innovative growth, as well as for policies that support men's and women's career development. ",

Scientific collaborations are the backbone of a successful career in science. Research ties facilitate links to additional contacts, assist the diffusion of emergent knowledge streams, and can provide scientists with access to new research opportunities across institutional, disciplinary, and geographic boundaries (Singh and Fleming, 2009; Inoue and Lui, 2015). Collaboration is also increasingly requisite; rates of collaborative efforts in science are increasing as “lone authorships” are in decline (National Science Board, 2004; Greene, 2007).

Science collaboration is built upon sets of repeated and reciprocal relations between scientists, and linkages between collaborators (and the collaborators of their collaborators) knit together a network of relations (Fleming and Marx, 2006). A scientist's location in this network and the relationships they form and sustain are shaped by the overarching status structure of science, in which hierarchical gender relations prevail (Fox et al., 2017). Against this backdrop is speculation that network benefits may be contingent on gender. By examining gender differences in collaborative positioning, and whether and how network benefits are contingent on gender, it is possible to identify critical factors related to network positioning and women's career attainments in science, and to inform theoretical perspectives about collaborative network mechanisms more generally.

The first regards the challenge of disambiguating patenting and publishing records. Until very recently, data was not readily available to link inventors and authors to their patenting and publishing records in a way that would allow researchers to easily construct unique collaborative profiles for scientists over time. Although not hindering research completely (see, for example, Fleming and Marx, 2006; Lai et al., 2010; Lai et al., 2011; Inoue and Liu, 2015), this has slowed the proliferation of knowledge about collaborative networking in science. In this research, I follow efforts of previous work to disambiguate inventor records and construct networks of collaboration over time (Lai et al., 2010; Lai et al., 2011). Similar efforts can be found in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) PatentsView platform, which employs probabilistic methodologies to disambiguate inventor records in a relational database (USPTO, 2016).

In this work, I utilize name frequency databases to create a probabilistic likelihood of inventors being male or female, a strategy in line with others (Moody, 2004; Frietsch et al., 2009; Meng, 2013; Sugimoto et al., 2015; Lariviere et al., 2013).

At the same time, scholars have recently turned an analytical lens beyond publication to additional indicators of research productivity, including those related to academic and industrial entrepreneurship and commercial activity. Innovation is connected to increased publication productivity (Stephan et al., 2007; Azoulay et al., 2009), and is valuable for academic success and rewards more broadly (Jacobs and Frickel, 2009). In addition, a focus on patenting allows for attention to be paid to the relationship of institutional location and gender equity in science, as the commercial context involves activity beyond academia in industry science, non-profit research institutes, government agencies, and pharmaceutical firms and chemical companies. Cross-sector activity knits together the social structure of science and presents a more accurate portrayal of science collaborations in the biomedical sciences. Methodologically, patenting data is publicly available, and is widely used in social and economic circles to assess individual, state, regional, and national indicators of innovative activity. A base of knowledge exists about inventor network relationships in the science realm (Fleming et al., 2007; Balconi et al., 2004; Obstfeld, 2005; Inoue and Liu, 2015), allowing for useful comparisons and meaningful implications.

Both tend to be conducted by teams of scientists utilizing recognized research practices, who formulate claims based on extant literature. Both codify results and mobilize evidence, and are governed by an external evaluation system. Furthermore, scientists with academic ties often publish and patent the results of the same research activities in patent/publication pairs (Murray, 2002; Murray and Stern, 2007). That said, commercial activity is more likely to be taken on by those who are highly productive in other performance metrics, such as publishing (Stuart and Ding, 2006), and to occur in certain settings over others (such as industrial science, and in research universities). The concern regarding women's involvement is that the increased emphasis on commercial activity may heighten gender gaps in status because those who are already successful appear better able to capitalize on commercial success (Colyvas et al., 2012).

Some industry settings - particularly firms of a “network form\" (Powell, 1990)—-reveal more equity than others (Whittington and Smith-Doerr, 2005, 2008). Compared to men, women are also less likely to be present in other commercial endeavors, such as licensing (Duque et al., 2005), consulting (Corley and Gaughan, 2010), participation in private sector scientific advisory boards (Ding et al., 2013), and company founding (Lowe and Gonzalez Brambilia, 2007). Research finds that a significant hurdle for women may occur at the stage of first involvement, especially in the academy where such activities are not “required” (Whittington, 2011). In interviews with women scientists at a prominent university, Murray and Graham (2007) report that women describe less exposure to the commercial process and fewer opportunities to disclose than men (see also Ding et al., 2006). Women also report fewer invitations from others to participate in commercial activity, and different sources of support for commercial involvement then men—women from close colleagues in comparable positions (and from technology licensing offices), and men from senior advisors.

Given the importance of network factors in innovative activity more generally, it is reasonable to assume that accounting for these may help explain gender disparities in innovation, or reveal sites for which targeted policy or best practices may be applied. The data used in this analysis speak to women's positioning in co-inventing networks at the point of theirfirst patent and beyond. If the hurdle of first patenting is the point of greatest disparity between men and women, we might anticipate similar collaborative locations between men and women scientists who have already reached this milestone. However, the fact of divergence in sources of support and connection to the commercial process for men and women (and a long line of research on the ways in which gender infuses the organization and practice of science (National Science Board, 2004)) implies that gender may interact with opportunity in ways that reveal differential locations for men and women in commercially collaborative networks (and perhaps differential benefits of collaborative ties down the line).

Men tend to have predominantly male networks, while women tend to have female or mixed networks (McKinsey and LeanIn.Org, 2015). Women tend to have network compositions with more strong, dense, relations (as opposed to diverse or spanning “brokerage” ties?), and tend to be tied to fewer influential individuals (Brass, 1985; Moore, 1990; Ibarra, 1993; McGuire, 2002). In some settings, these different types of connections have been shown to provide alternate routes to success for men and women (Ibarra, 1997). Some of the variation is likely related to structural differences in occupation and/or job rank (Brass, 1985; Moore, 1990; Ibarra, 1992), yet beliefs about gender also form a background frame from which workplace decisions and outcomes are made (Ridgeway, 2011), and especially in the context of science and entrepreneurship (Wajcman, 1991; Thébaud, 2010; Tinkler et al., 2015).

We might also expect to find decreases in these differences as the number of women in the patenting network grows over time (in tandem with the growth of women in biomedical fields more broadly, and reductions in gender disparities in STEM more broadly); thus, accounting for time in the network may reduce the extent of women's lower aggregate patenting activity compared to men. But this work allows for an examination of areas where previous literature is quiet: the extent to which women are isolated or on the periphery in collaborative science spaces, whether gender differentials exist between men and women when considering frequently invoked centrality measures (degree centrality, closeness centrality, aggregate constraint, etc.4), and how they may differ in the types of collaborators they have (collaborator statusandpositioning).

For example, there appears to be a greater ability among men to leverage their positions and credentials (e.g. hierarchical rank, existing network contacts, educational degrees) into centralized network positions (Miller et al., 1981; Ibarra, 1992). In a case study of promotion in a workplace, Burt (1998) finds that female managers most likely to be promoted have strong ties to superiors and dense networks of close ties to colleagues, whereas successful men receive more from maintaining important brokerage, or spanning, ties (of which women had fewer) (Burt, 1992, 2005). Burt attributes this to the need for women to attain \"borrowed social capital\" in the eyes of their superiors, who make decisions about their upward mobility (1998, page 6). Related work utilizing an experimental setting in venture capital decision-making also finds tie contingencies based on gender (Tinkler et al., 2015). In a simulated environment where differences between a male and female entrepreneur seeking funding were otherwise equal, Tinkler and colleagues found that although both men and women entrepreneurs benefited with the “endorsement\" of a trusted colleague, the tie benefits women received were much greater and consequential than they were for men. Like Burt, Tinkler et al. highlight the status and/or signaling effects that ties can provide, and suggest that women more so than men benefit from certain indicators of potential. Connections to key players - and also technical background in their context—helped to instill confidence in evaluators and mitigate uncertainty in their abilities in this male-typed setting. In both cases, underlying status processes yield network influences that differ or are altered for men relative to women. On the one hand, Burt's (1998) work suggests that the type of influential tie may vary: women in the business setting he studied did not see as much reward for spanning relations (e.g. connections to diverse, otherwise unconnected,others) as did men. On the other hand, the work of Tinkler et al. finds that while network signaling is helpful for both men and women, it is particularly consequential for women. ",

On one hand, although the content and science may be the same, women inventors are involved in networks of collaborations that are—at least as related to gender—significantly more diverse in nature across settings. The implication is that women may \"bring into and/or better locate other women\" in the commercial context. On the other hand, the fact that there are far fewer women than men in life science commercial networks, suggests that the tendency for homophily may mean women experience a reduced set of available collaborators compared to their male colleagues.

In the case of brokerage, the final model reveals no gender differential in the odds of patenting between men and women who lack a brokerage position. For nonbrokers, the baseline odds of patenting in a future year for men and women are 0.31 and 0.30, respectively.

Although it is not appropriate to compare the direct effect for gender across the set of non-linear nested models, model fit statistics suggest that both network and non-network characteristics shed light on inventor propensity to patent in the life sciences. Each nested model improves in fit; and models that isolate network and non-network variables contribute independently to this fit.2° In the baseline model (Model 1), the predicted odds of patenting for men are 0.55 and 0.45 for women (when all other variables are held at their observed value). The inclusion of nonnetwork variables (Model 2) reveals predicted odds of 0.59 for men and 0.55 for women, suggesting that these characteristics serve to decrease the gap. The final, fully specified model that adds network variables predict the odds of men patenting to be 0.89, and that of women 0.70 (Model 10).21 These results provide support for previous work that emphasizes the strength of “sorting” dynamics (such as women's differential rates of participation across science fields) in explaining aggregate differences between men's and women's innovative activity in science (see, for example, Hunt et al., 2013). While sorting effects (and other nonnetwork characteristics) can help us understand how differences in men's and women's experience, international reach, and distribution across types of institutions play a role in the gender gap in propensity to patent, the results of the final model suggest that there are still differences in men's and women's propensity to patent despite controlling for these and network measures. The likelihood of patenting again is high, and wellpositioned network relationships benefit everyone's odds of patenting. Yet men's differential rewards result in findings of greater average disparity between men and women after network positioning and tie influence is taken into account. ",

In contrast, there is a negative relationship between inventor's patent count and being tied to many collaborators who have many co-inventing ties themselves—that is, inventors that are tied to those with fewer co-inventors tend to have more patents in their portfolio. It is possible that this may relate to typical divisions of labor in laboratory science—with technicians and other support staff represented periodically on patents associated with PIs that have many collaborators. This may also relate to notions that cohesion and strong ties can lead to innovative redundancy for inventors (Fleming et al., 2007).

Scholars have not ignored the fact that network influences on collaborative activity may underscore many of these dynamics (Hunt et al., 2013), yet gaining access to these in an analytically fruitful way has been challenging.

The results show that women inventors are not more peripheral in terms of their close ties and access to indirect others, nor that they are located amongst less dense subsets of ties (clustering) or to those for whom their ties are “less important”\" (aggregate constraint). As expected, however, a focus on collaborative networks reveals substantial differences between men and women with respect to their strategic positioning among other inventors. Most notably, women are much less likely to collaborate in positions traditionally thought to lead to added innovative benefits—positions that hold brokerage opportunities. In addition, men tend to include more men in their collaborations, women more women, and women have more status-asymmetric ties. Given that the network is comprised of scientists who all have at least one patent, and that scientists involved in commercial activity are a minority in the life science population, we might expect these similarities and differences to be at the low end of what we would see if able to take into account the positioning of those not (yet) involved in commercial life science.

Previous work has found little difference in the scientific quality men's and women's work, including in patenting and other commercial endeavors (Whittington and SmithDoerr, 2009). This has led scholars to suggest that increasing the number of women involved in scientific activity is thus tied to increasing the quality of scientific capacity more generally. Furthermore, greater diversity among creators of science and technology tends to lead to better knowledge and products (e.g. Jehn et al., 1999). Accordingly, diversity and gender equity are seen more and more on the agenda of global forums, and in the mission statements of funding agencies and public and private institutions. The focus of this research dovetails with that of those looking to understand the effects of diversity on collaborative endeavors, and well as diversity and inclusion initiatives. If women inventors are involved in more diverse networks of collaborations (at least in terms of gender-homophilous ties), the implication is that women may be more likely to bring other women (and new ideas) into the commercial context. A tendency towards homophily and gender-homophilous benefits, however, may disproportionately stifle women inventors when there are far fewer women in the collaborative space more generally. Attention to building men's and women's communication and cooperation, towards balancing gender representation in research teams and policy and decision making groups, and to sustaining careers (especially, women's advancement in the discipline), may help improve innovation and research quality as it relates to these findings.

In this, there is a need for better clarity around the mechanisms by which women are less likely to gain access to and benefit from strategic positions. It remains a question for future research whether the differences between men and women arise from issues of underrepresentation or social differences more generally, and may include: the types of connections men and women have (that is, how ties come to fruition and in what context); the ways in which women and men extract downstream resources from their connections; the availability of collaborators in one's immediate network; and/or from other, not yet specified, mechanisms related to men's and women's network locations.

Although the nature of the disparity varies across measures and is not uniformly present across all years, the broad trend may be due to the fact that multi-national firms patent more and are also distributed more broadly globally (where gender disparities may be more pronounced). It may also be due to differences in women's likelihood of working in corporate R&D. A final factor may be related to the incentive structure and logic of organizing in these firms. Collaborative settings and those with a more horizontal distribution of work relations (such as that of dedicated biotechnology firms and in academia) may boost women's integration and have been shown to be more gender equitable in terms of leadership positons (Smith-Doerr, 2004) and in patenting and publishing productivity (Whittington and Smith-Doerr, 2008; Sugimoto et al., 2015).
