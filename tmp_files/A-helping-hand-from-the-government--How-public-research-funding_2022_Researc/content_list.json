Our study, however, proposes that the positive impact of public funds is much weaker in less-prestigious universities than in prestigious ones, and that overdependence on public research funding in fact even hurts academic output quality in less-prestigious universities. We find evidence for this claim in a dataset from among Chinese 622 universities in the period 2010-2017. The negative correlation between high dependence on public research funding and academic output quality is not uniform but depends on specific conditions. It is likely to be weaker in less-prestigious research-oriented universities and in less prestigious universities dedicated to fundamental research. Moreover, we find that for them collaboration with top universities and a high proportion of senior scientists can mitigate the negative impact that high dependence on public research funding has on academic output quality and improve the efficiency in the spending of public funds. Our study contributes to the literature by highlighting differences between prestigious and less-prestigious universities in terms of how public funds affect academic output and by evaluating the impact of government involvement in scientific research at the university-level and it is the first study globally to do so.

The share of direct research funding supported by the government has gradually decreased, while the share of private research funding has increased (Auranen and Nieminen, 2010). At the same time, many countries have embraced a performancebased funding approach to allocate government research funding to universities (Bratti et al., 2004). Nonetheless, government-oriented research funding is still the dominant source of scientific research funding in universities. Numerous studies provide empirical evidence that public research funding has a positive and significant impact on academic output in terms of publications, patents or other forms of scientific innovation (Adams et al., 2005; Beaudry and Allaoui, 2012; Gush et al., 2018; Payne and Siow, 2003).

        "text": "As Shibayama (2011） has argued, equal distribution of funding among all institutions has always been an issue of great interest. Since the 1990s, China planned to sponsor top Chinese universities to further their position in international rankings and launched the 211 Project and the 985 Project. The 211 Project was initiated in 1995 and entitled “High-Level Universities and Key Disciplinary Fields Project', which involved 116 universities. And then the 985 Project began in 1998 and aimed to develop world-class universities.Some 39 top universities were on the 985 list. Universities listed as 985 or 211 projects enjoy higher policy priority and obtain large amounts of research funding from the government. They have developed quickly and created a large gap in quality of education and research vis-a-vis other universities in a period of two decades (Zhang, 2013). Thus 985 & 211 Projects universities can be called ‘prestigious universities’ because of their augmented research capabilities and enhanced reputations. In recent years, in order to prevent the “Matthew effect” in Chinese universities (Tang and Miao, 2014), the state has also invested plenty of scientific research funding in less-prestigious universities for reasons of equity. This study defines “less-prestigious universities’ as ones excluded from China's 985 Project and 211 Project. According to official data issued by the Chinese government, research funding supported by public bodies spent in lessprestigious universities rose from 2003 million US dollars in 2010 to 5565 million US dollars in 2017, an increase of $178~\\%$ 2Sincethe number of less-prestigious universities has increased in the period 2010-2017, we calculated the average government-oriented research funding received by each university, which was at 3.63 million US dollars in 2010 and at 6.13 million US dollars in 2017 as shown in Fig. 1. The increase in average funding of less-prestigious universities is consistent with the total funding. Undoubtedly, the rapid increase in funding for scientific research helps these less-prestigious universities conduct more research and generate more academic output, with an increaseof $35.3~\\%$ in the total number of publications from 2010 to 2017,3 but the question remains whether government-oriented research funding for less-prestigious universities really helps them to improve their research capability. Some analysts also argue that targeting public funding to suitable universities and scientific fields is crucial to accelerating scientific innovation (Wu, 2015). Thus, an intriguing trade-off between equity and efficiency seems to emerge. Indeed, China's system for funding scientific research has been controversial in its way of allocating funds (Hu, 2020; Shi and Rao, 2010). That is why we propose to evaluate the impact of public funding on the research capacity of less prestigious universities. Specifically, we aim to identify if more generous funding from public sources leads to better research and output, and if the helping hand of the government effectively moderates the Matthew effect among Chinese universities.

Here, ‘dependence on public research funding’ is defined as the extent to which a university's total research funding depends on public funding. Since the total research funds in universities are composed by two main parts: public research funding from the government and private research funding from private players, we measure ‘dependence on public research funding’ by ‘public research funding/total research funding', which is a ratio. This indicator serves for us as an important proxy for governmental intervention - the higher the ratio, the stronger the dependence on government funds a university's research activity is presumed to be. Specifically, we investigate whether the availability of public funding has led to higher research capacity in less-prestigious universities by taking the research output quality as the proxy variable of research capability. We manually collected the publications data of 622universitiesforthetimeframe2010-2017fromtheWebofScience (WoS). Based on the literature and interviewees we consulted, we believe the number of WoS publications accurately reflects academic output quality4 (Auranen and Nieminen, 2010). ",

First, an analysis of direct public financial support for scientific research sheds light on the role of the government in research competence among universities. The effect of governmental support for scientific research in universities, especially in less-prestigious universities for reasons of equity, gives rise to important dilemmas. However, despite its importance, to the best of our knowledge, few empirical studies have touched on the extent of government-involvement on funding and academic competence in universities. This contribution fills this gap in the literature. Second, our study contributes to existing literature by distinguishing prestigious universities and less-prestigious universities in their reaction to public research funds. Academics working in prestigious universities and less-prestigious universities may well adopt different strategies to deal with public resources. This distinction is of great significance to the evaluation of the effectiveness of direct financial support provided by governments on scientific research. Third, going beyond prior studies that adopted macro data to investigate the impact of public research funds, this study offers a powerful analysis adopting university-level data and individual interviews. Universitylevel analysis is essential because most public scientific funds are allocated directly to universities in China and first-hand data from interviews are precious for empirical analysis. Last, the heterogeneity analysis on public funding depending on various attributes provides broader insight on issues of public funding for research in China and other emerging economies with limited resources for research.

Some scholars have found a positive impact of research funding on the output of universities (Beaudry and Allaoui, 2012; Gush et al., 2018). In China, scholars have also conducted empirical analyses and argued that research funding provided by the government increases the output in universities (Chen et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,2013). Research and teaching are both core activities within universities, but research competence is what separates prestigious universities from their less prestigious cousins (Goodall, 2009). Although public research funding is positively related to academic output, less-prestigious universities may not make full use of public research funding in creating valuable output when compared with prestigious universities.

Educational resource asymmetries and cumulative advantages lead prestigious universities develop higher levels of efficiency in scientific research. After decade-long implementation of China's 985 & 211 projects, those prestigious universities have cumulated much improved research capabilities and academic reputations (Zhang et al., 2013). The prestigious universities involved in the projects therefore enjoy higher trust levels in education quality, research capability and so on in the eyes of its various publics (Collins and Park, 2016). In contrast, the research input-output ratio among less-prestigious universities still appears less than satisfactory because of their underdeveloped research capability.

Since most Chinese universities are public institutes, government-oriented research funding is essential to supporting their research activities. Basic research poses relatively high requirements on infrastructure conditions and laboratory settings, and these facilities are strongly dependent on government funding. Therefore, rising public funds will contribute to higher scientific research output when universities are in the stage of accumulating scientific and technological infrastructure (Zhang et al., 2021). Stable long-term funding offers a guarantee for the continuation of research activities in universities, especially universities with fundamental research with low levels of immediate profitability.

For instance, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tend to be extremely risk-averse and their peer reviews are too conservative, putting higher weight on the likelihood of success rather than the potential impact of the output (Park et al., 2015). In contrast, privately funded research can be used more flexibly because they are not earmarked for specific purposes; scientists have discretion as to when and how to spend it and can use it for highly innovative projects with higher levels of risk (Heinze et al., 2009). Thus, private research funding may allow for the possibility of serendipitous results and propose unorthodox ideas, thereby achieving academic breakthroughs with higher output quality while public funds may result in more publications but compromising research quality because of their low flexibility (Payne and Siow, 2003). Thus, as dependence of public funds moves from low to high levels, universities will obtain necessary support from government but the disadvantages of governmental intervention rise rather incrementally with the increasing dependence.

Academics working in less prestigious universities could shy away from risk and complexity and conduct safer, less creative and more mediocre forms of research (Jung and Lee, 2014; Park et al., 2015). Meanwhile, governments lack adequate mechanisms to measure ex-post academic output in universities due to information asymmetry (Goldfarb, 2008; Raudla et al., 2015). The researchers in prestigious university could easily satisfy the lowest standard because of their solid academic accumulation. They always try to involve some innovative work no matter if the government will have the enough regulatory information. However, researchers at less-prestigious universities tend be more conservative and give priority to meeting the strict requirements regarding publication numbers in evaluation standards (Payne and Siow, 2003).

Consequently, basic research primarily depends on public funds because of its quasi-public goods attributes (Xia et al., 2020). Contrary to applied research which has a stronger commercial orientation, basic research is focused on the observation of phenomena, i.e. it barely helps practitioners to obtain direct economic benefits (Czarnitzki and Thorwarth, 2012). Prettner and Werner (2016) even argued that basic research institutions are barely able to reap any financial benefits. Basic research thus attracts little private sector funding because the knowledge is nonexcludable and generates low private returns. Moreover, it has the characteristics of long cycles, high costs and unpredictability. Meanwhile, the total investment in basic research is still large, and it faces a higher risk of failure. By implication, risky, fundamental and disinterested basic research with single sources of funding may be more likely to flourish in countries with more generous and predictable public research funding (Bentley et al., 2015). For example, Jacob and Lefgren (2011) have suggested that the impact of government-oriented funding (NIH) is larger among researchers based in hospitals relative to researchers in universities or research institutes who arguably have greater sources of funding outside of the NIH.

Second, researchers and staff working at Science and Technology Departments of different universities have confirmed to us in interviews that papers indexed in SCI tend to be more innovative than average.

Public research funding refers to the scientific research funds provided by governments at the various levels and aims at supporting research activities in universities. It has two forms: direct funding and research project-led funding. The project-led funds can be supported by central or local governments. For instance, the National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC), the National Social Science Foundation and National Key Research and Development Program are supported by the central government, while the lion's share of research projects are supported by provincial or municipal governments. Normally, the research project-led funds from the central government as NSFC are highly competitive while the direct funding and the project-led funds provided by local governments are mainly awarded on the basis of fairness and distribution? (Gonzalez-Brambila and Veloso, 2007). In this study, we describe public research funding by employing the total number of research funding provided by governments for each university.The currency used in this study is Chinese yuan (CNY) and we convert the public research funds from nominal prices to constant prices for the Year 2009.

Governments delegate research in varying degrees to universities which would otherwise lack the financial support to carry out this research (Sanz-Menéndez and Cruz-Castro, 2003). In order to measure the extent of government involvement in a university's scientific research activities, we propose the concept 'dependence on public research funding'. We calculate dependence on public research funding by ‘public research funding/total research funding'. Hence this dependence is the ratio of government research funding to all research funding that a university receives during the year. This ratio ranges from $0\\,\\%$ to $100\\,\\%$ . When a university has public research funds only, the ratio of that university would be $100~\\%$ indicating that the research activities in that university completely depend on governments. From the international evidence, Geuna and Piolatto (2016) came up with similar indicator to measure the involvement of government and they argued that the UK has a more competitive system involving more private funding (the dependence on public funding is about $50\\ \\%)$ ，while Italy depends mostly on public funding (the dependence on public funding is about $75\\ \\%$ 0.For Chinese lessprestigious universities, the average dependence on public funding is $62\\;\\%$ in the year of 2016.

The admission standards of universities vary across disciplines and provinces.9 We define a first-tier admission university as a university that must admit science students in first-tier admission in more than half of the provinces (except for the province in which the university is located). Second, we further control the difference in research capacity among lessprestigious universities by research scale and research projects. We use the number of R&D researchers to denote the research scale of a university. Meanwhile, the number of approved projects be funded by the NSFC can represent a university's scientific research competitiveness well.

Prestigious universities derive more advantages from public funds to improve their research quality than lessprestigious ones, which supports our hypothesis 1. However, Column 1c in Table 2 shows that the interaction term between public research funding and the level of universities is not significant. This means that prestigious and less-prestigious universities do not show significant differences in their research output quantity when they take the same amount of public funds. This is also consistent with our hypothesis 2. Based on the information from our interviews, the researchers in lessprestigious universities will complete their proposed project sponsored by government in the lowest standard rather than to pursue innovation. Thus, in less-prestigious universities, more publications can be expected than in prestigious universities, but their contribution to research quality remains very limited. These findings indicate that the impact of financial support from the government will vary among universities at different levels: given the same level of public funding, less-prestigious universities are associated with lower academic output quality than prestigious universities.

These findings suggest that too much reliance on public funding will hurt academic output quality in less-prestigious universities. The lower flexibility of public research funding is the main reason of the academic output quality reduction based on the previous discussion in Section 2.2. Contrary to the public research funding, private research funding gives scientists greater freedom and allows them to shift research funds in the research direction that seems (to them) most innovative. This flexibility allows private research funding to encourage a bias toward truly novel but riskier research over incremental publications with high levels of certainty. The complementarity of public funds and private funds cannot be ignored. A higher share of private research funds is essential for a less-prestigious university's academic output quality. The helping hand from the government alone will not work well.

We interpret this result as suggesting that the less-prestigious universities with a doctoral program position themselves as research-oriented universities which stimulate highly innovative projects more, which is beneficial to academic breakthroughs and better research output quality. Thus, academic operations in these research-oriented less-prestigious universities may take more advantage of public research funds compared with teachingoriented or professional universities. ",

Medical universities always have the largest proportion of fundamental research compared to other types of universities, as discussed before. We can therefore conclude that universities dedicated to fundamental research are able to moderate the negative link between dependence on public funds and research quality, supporting our hypothesis 4. This finding makes sense since fundamental research demands more government financial support. Private funds spent on fundamental research are limited because the uncertainty of obtaining commercial outcomes is too high, and the prospects of application unknown. As Goldstein and Narayanamurti (2018) argue, technological advancement in areas such as healthcare require higher levels of public support. ",

But it would be equally intriguing if there is a negative relationship between high dependence on public funds and academic output in prestigious universities. Thus, in order to underline the difference in the public funds-academic output link between prestigious and less-prestigious universities, we conducted a test on the samples of 102 prestigious universities in the same observation period based on Model 2-2. The results differ markedly from those for less-prestigious universities. The link between dependence on public funds and research quality is significantly positive no matter how we measure research quality: by numbers of WoS papers $(p<0.10)$ or proportion of WoS papers $(p<$ 0.05). A significantly positive nexus between dependence and research quality exists for the prestigious universities, as shown in Column 1 and 2 of Table 4. These findings indicate that the governmental support on scientific research is more effective for prestigious universities while the less prestigious universities appear to be more sensitive to the drawbacks of public research funds.

We began with the negative binomial model to estimate the relationship between dependence on public research funding and research quality. The results are reported in Column 1 of Table 5, and consistent with the findings of the benchmark regression mentioned above. Second, we reformulated the dependent variables to check for robustness. We used the percentage of the number of articles included in the WoS core dataset as compared to the total number of published articles as an alternative dependent variable. The result in Column 2 of Table 5 indicates that negative and significant effects of the dependence on government research funding on academic output remain unchanged. Third, considering that there are some highquality papers from CNKI sources, for instance CSsCI-indexed1° papers, we employed the sum number of SCI and CssCI as another measure of research quality to estimate the benchmark model. Column 3 of Table 5 shows the that results still remain unchanged. Forth, we changed the data source to measure the research quality. We used the numbers of the articlespublishedindomesticandinternationaljournalstodenote research quality through the Compilation of Scientific and Technical Statistics of Chinese Higher Education and the significant and negative relationship was consistent with the benchmark model. Last but not least, there is possible endogeneity in our models since weaker academic performance could also lead to higher dependence on public funds. In order to avoid the endogeneity problem, we adopted GMM to reestimate the model. And we chose the economic vitalityll of the city where a university locates as our instrumental variable (IV) to reestimate the impact of Dependence in a 2SLS regression model as well. The results still proved robust after the possible endogeneity problem has been resolved, as shown in Column 5-6 of Table 5. ",

Top scientists publish high-quality articles not only because of their research capability but also because their academic reputation prevents them from churning out low-quality output.

In the first stage we demonstrated that more generous public research funding resulted in higher academic output but that this positive link between government funds and academic output is much weaker in lessprestigious universities. The results draw our attention to existing mechanisms for improving research competence to utilize public research funding by less-prestigious universities. In the second stage, our evidence showed the existence of an inverted U-shaped link between the dependence on public research funding and academic output in lessprestigious universities in China: over-dependence on public research funds even hurts academic output quality. The attributes of public research funding and characteristics of less-prestigious universities jointly result in poor research quality. Differentiating less-prestigious universities according to their different missions, we found that the negative relationship between dependence on public funds and research output quality was weaker for research-oriented less-prestigious universities. Moreover, less-prestigious universities dedicated to fundamental research actually made better use of government funds. Finally, we made it clear that collaborating with 985 project universities and attracting senior scientists are crucial ingredients for improving research competence amongless-prestigious universities when the samelevel of financial support is provided by the government.

Conventional academic literature and the popular press tend to appeal to governments to skew education resources toward less-prestigious universities in order to avoid the Matthew effect among Chinese universities, but our findings suggest that efficiency across universities is different, and governments cannot simply increase the level of funding for everybody in order to boost scientific output. In fact, too much government intervention is likely to hurt academic output quality in less renowned universities, at least in China. Policymakers need to recognize that China's system for funding scientific research may have inefficiency problems. However, we wish to emphasize that we are not making a plea for the government to stop supporting less-prestigious universities. Rather, we suggest that policies of national and local governments should promote diversity within higher education and change the mode through which research in less-prestigious universities is promoted. Policymakers should re-examine current funding principles.  For instance, is it a wise choice to encourage all the universities (including teaching-oriented less-prestigious ones) to engage in scientific research work? How can the way in which funds are allocated in China's R&D funding system be improved? All these issues should be further understood. ",
