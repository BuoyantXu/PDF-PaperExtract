By jointly estimating the three equations we find that the inventors? level of education, employment in a large firm, and involvement in large-scale research projects positively correlate with quantity. Yet, apart from the size of the research project, none of these factors directly influence the expected value of the inventions. They do, however, have an indirect influence, as we find that the number of patents explains the probability of producing a technological hit (the maximum value). Also, there is no regression to the mean in the invention process at an individual level, as the number of inventions that an inventor produces is not correlated with the average value. ",

The difficulty to obtain information about individual inventors has prevented previous research from performing systematic empirical studies on this matter.

In fact, inventors’ productivity may take various forms. While the number of patents that they develop is one form, the inventors often acquire visibility for the technological and economic importance of their inventions, and sometimes their reputation depends on one or several, major achievements (Jones, 2005). This calls for an indicator of the technological and economic importance of the inventions. We start by using the number of citations that the patents have received within 5 years of their publication date (i.e., forward citations). Alternatively, by combining different patent indicators, we extract a composite index - i.e., a common component - that proxies for the technological and economic importance of the inventions, as in Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004).

Oster and Hamermesh (1998) follow the careers of 208 economists in the economic departments of 17 top research institutions who received PhD degrees between 1959 and 1983. They provide evidence that publishing diminishes with age. They also demonstrate the presence of persistent heterogeneity among individuals: the most productive economists early in their careers keep producing high-value research (though at a lower rate) as they become older. In a cross-section analysis of American scientists, Cole (1979) finds that age is concavely related to the quantity and quality of their productivity. Turner and Mairesse (in press) explore the differences in productivity among French condensed matter physicists between 1986 and 1997 in terms of the number and impact of their publications. They find a strong impact of individual and institutional characteristics. For the same sample of scientists, Hall et al.

An important novelty of our work is that, among other factors, it also controls for the characteristics of the individual inventors. As far as research productivity is concerned, while quantity is defined by the number of inventions that the inventors contributed to inventing, value is measured by two patent indicators that the literature shows to be correlated with the ex post economic value of the inventions.2 For example, Trajtenberg (1990) shows that there is a close association between patent counts weighted by forward citations and the social value of inventions in the computer tomography scanner industry. Harhoff et al. (1999) demonstrate that the number of backward citations to previous patents and to the non-patent literature, and the number of forward citations received after the publication date is positively correlated with the value of the inventions. Schankerman and Pakes (1986) use patent renewal data to estimate the value of patent rights, while others use the number of countries in which the patent is applied for and the number of claims in the patent application as indicators of the value of the patents (see, for example, Putnam, 1996). Finally, patents that undergo opposition and annulment procedures are also shown to be more valuable (Harhoff and Reitzig,2004). ",

The matching software ran on two tables: a searching table with information on the 793 PatVal-EU inventors and a reference table with all the potential EPO matching patents extracted from Delphion.4 The match between the EPO patents and the inventors was performed by using a set of weighted criteria: inventor's last name, first name, middle name, and technological class. The matching software browsed the reference table and reported the probability for each patent to be a“good match\" with the inventor in the searching table. At the end of this process we checked the list of inventors manually in order to remove the patents invented by homonymous inventors.

The age of the inventors in 1995 is included in linear and in quadratic form (AGE and $\\mathrm{AGE}^{2}$ ).This is to mimic existing work in the literature that the effect of age on the researchers’ productivity may first increase and then decline with age. Cole (1979), for example, studied the relationship between age and the quantity and quality (measured by means of citations) of publications of American scientists in six fields in 1965-1969. He found that, in general, age is curvilinearly related to such productivity measures: productivity first increases and peaks in the late 1930s-1940s (and 1950s for quality), and then it declines. The curve is less steep for the quality of the publications than for their quantity. The educational background proxies for the inventors’ unobservable ability and for the knowledge that they embody and that was assimilated in the different stages of the scientific training. We employ the highest degree of education of the inventors among the following four types: Secondary School (SecSc), High School (HighSc), University BSc or Master (Uni), PhD (PhD). We expect the level of education to be positively correlated with the quantity and value of the patents that the inventors produce. Not only is this because inventors with better ability and scientific knowledge are expected to be more productive, but also because education might be a signal that the inventors and the employer organizations use to search for a good “match\" between the research potential of the former and the characteristics of the latter.8 ",

As far as the number of patents granted by the EPO to the applicant organizations is concerned (PATSORG), we use the data provided by the PatVal-EU database.9 PATSORG is a proxy for the capacity to innovate and the propensity to file patents of the applicant organization. Moreover, the development of inventions often requires extensive resources in terms of technical equipment, research laboratories, instruments, research assistants, and complementary expertise. The type of organization in which the inventor is employed partially proxies for the availability of such resources. We differentiate between large firms (LARGE), small and medium companies (SME), and public research organizations (GOV). Compared to SME and GOV, large firms might have the financial resources to engage in complex research projects, to produce a large number of inventions, and to apply for patent protection for many inventions. They are also likely to be endowed with a large pool of heterogeneous and specialised researchers that are involved in a wide number of larger research projects compared to smaller enterprises. We expect these characteristics to be positively correlated with the productivity of the individual inventors, both in terms of quantity and maximum value of the inventions. It is more difficult to predict the effect of these variables on the average value of the inventions. For example, if large companies have the financial strength and the human resources to apply for patent protection not only for important inventions, but also for less valuable ones, this might produce a decline in the average value of the patented inventions both at the company and at the inventor level. The net effect of the size of the firm on the average value will depend on the extent to which higher value inventions compensate for the number of low value patents that are applied for. By controlling for the size and type of the employer organization, we also separate the effect of the scale of the organization from its patent propensity, which otherwise would both be reflected by the same PATSORG variable.

Only NINV is still statistically significant at 0.05 on both AVQ and MAXQ, suggesting that investment in large-scale research projects and collaboration among researchers are positively correlated with both the number and the value of the inventions, when value is measured with the composite index.15 ",

This might be because large firms provide the inventors with the financial resources and complementary expertise to develop and apply for many patents. Also, large firms might provide the inventors with the incentives to produce a large number of inventions, as they use this information to identify and reward productive inventors.16 In turn, the larger the number of patents, the higher the probability of developing a valuable invention: more ideas are correlated with better ideas.

Inventor and organizational characteristics are only indirectly important for value, as they positively influence the number of the inventors'′ patents. Finally, we find no regression to the mean in the average value as NPAT increases, suggesting that the average value of an inventor's patents is mostly determined by stochastic factors. ",

Although it is not within the scope of this paper to analyze systematically this issue, Fig. 4 gives some insights into the “learning versus stochastic” process for producing high value patents. It depicts the progression of the patent value index (in logs) over 1988-1998 for a sub-sample of 39 male inventors employed in large firms, with a PhD degree and with more than 10 EPO inventions in the period.17 ",

Each line identifies an inventor. As a first approximation it is hard to extrapolate a specific monotonic trend in patent value at the inventor level, either decreasing or increasing as the number of patents grows. Although these results are not conclusive, they would suggest that no learning process is at work in the relationship between quantity and value, and that the positive correlation between NPAT and MAXCITE (and MAXQ) is the output of a stochastic process, where the number of patents is correlated with the probability of finding a maximum.

In so doing it used information on the individual characteristics of 793 inventors drawn from the PatVal-EU database and on 4376 EPO patents that they contributed to inventing in the period 1988-1998. Quantity is measured by the number of EPO patents that the inventors produced. Value is computed by means of the number of forward citations that the patents received within 5 years of the publication date, and alternatively, by a common component index as developed by Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004). With these indicators we constructed two measures of patent value at the level of individual inventor: the average value and the value of the best patent among those that he contributed to inventing.

By using seemingly unrelated regressions and the matrix of variance-covariance between the residuals of the three equations, our findings are twofold. First, the drivers of quantity differ from the factors that impact value. Specifically, inventors with a high level of education and employed in large firms are more likely to produce a large quantity of patents. Inventor and firm characteristics, however, do not impact directly on the expected value of the inventions, neither average nor maximum. They do only indirectly, as we find that the number of patents that the inventor produces is positively correlated with the maximum patent value. Second, we find no regression to the mean at the inventor level: as the number of patents per inventor gets larger, the average value of the inventions does not decrease. ",

Although indirectly through quantity, they affect value. This confirms that a key resource for fostering invention, both in terms of number and value, is the availability and employment of highly educated researchers, which, in turn, depends on investment in high level and postgraduate education and training. Moreover, the importance of the inventors' education and the fact that their productivity distribution is skewed reinforce the “retaining the best’ policy (Narin and Breitzman, 1995): if ability is concentrated in a few key individuals, the organizations in which they are employed should do their best to retain them. This is particularly important if these individuals are responsible for both the quantity (directly) and value (indirectly) of the inventions developed by the organization, and if, at the inventor level, there is no regression to the mean in the average value of the inventions.
