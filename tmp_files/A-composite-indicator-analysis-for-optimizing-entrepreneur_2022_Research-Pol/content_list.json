By acknowledging that country-level entrepreneurship is a multidimensional construct shaped by multiple interactions between economic agents and the institutional setting backing entrepreneurial action, the concept of entrepreneurial ecosystem has become a ‘trendy’ topic within academic and policy communities (Acs et al., 2014; Autio et al., 2015). Countries cover a wide range of institutional settings, thus it is plausible to argue that the entrepreneurial ecosystem is governed by complex social and institutional interactions. This view is consistent with recent work emphasizing that the ecosystem's complexity—which results from its multidimensionality and materializes in different country-specific configurations—leads to different national outcomes (e.g., Brown and Mason, 2017; Spigel, 2017; Stam and Van de Ven, 2021). At this point, an important question is how entrepreneurial ecosystem analyses can be reconciled with the mainstream view that these two properties-i.e., complexity and geographic heterogeneity—condition both the configuration and the economic impact of this ecosystem.

Composite indicators have gained increased popularity among scholars and policy makers mostly because they compile into a single metric a complex phenomenon that cannot be fully captured with one variable, thus facilitating its communication and understanding (Booysen, 2002; Cherchye et al., 2007a). Also, CIs represent an alternative to statistical models with potentially limited practical application that neglect the multidimensionality of the phenomenon that the CI attempts to quantify and evaluate (Friedman and Schwartz, 1991). Thus, CIs have become a valuable tool for policy makers interested in identifying benchmarks and trends as well as setting policy priorities (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 2008). Studies based on CIs have been used in different fields including, among others, economics (e.g., internal market index, global competitiveness index or county competitiveness), human development (e.g., human development index), and quality of life (e.g., better life index) (Cherchye et al., 2007a; Despotis, 2005; Lafuente et al., 2020; Mizobuchi, 2014).

First, CIs are criticized by the subjectivity of their construction.Conceptual criticism mostly highlights the lack of scientific consensus about what theoretical model should provide a detailed description of the variables used to explain the studied phenomenon (Cherchye et al., 2008). Subjective choices condition the way CIs answer relevant questions related to the phenomenon that CIs attempt to summarize (Booysen, 2002). The second source of criticism is linked to the absence of clear guidance on the weighting system that should be applied to the CI sub-indicators. Weights are decisive elements of CIs as they determine the trade-offs between the selected variables. Weights condition CI results which may lead to inaccurate conclusions if subjective criteria are used to set weights (Grupp and Schubert, 2010; Mizobuchi, 2014). ",

Existing research mostly uses index metrics (i.e., output / input) based on either firm-level (e.g., new firms divided by the stock of firms) or individual-level data (e.g., the total entrepreneurial activity created by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, $\\mathrm{GEM^{1}})$ to inform policy makers and assess the role of entrepreneurship on the economy. The observed mismatch between the analyzed concept (entrepreneurial ecosystem) and the measurement approach (firm- and individual-level data) may well explain the inconclusive results reported in prior work dealing with country-level entrepreneurship and its repercussions at national and sub-national levels (Acs et al., 2018; Naudé, 2011).

Second, from a policy perspective, every country has its own social and economic priorities and what can be considered a desirable policy in one country may not be so in another context. The flexibility of the BOD model supports this argument. Mimicking policies adopted by advanced countries in developing economies without proper adaptation to the socioeconomic context would not help to improve the quality of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in these countries. By computing endogenous, non-arbitrary weights, the BOD model recognizes territorial heterogeneity and allows countries to identify the most relevant aspects of their entrepreneurial ecosystem based on their specific institutional and market conditions.

In this discussion, entrepreneurship has been invoked as a conduit mechanism of economic growth and innovation (Aghion, 2017; Schumpeter, 1934). However, the outcomes of entrepreneurship are conditional on the environment within which they take place (Autio et al., 2015).

Rooted in ecological metaphors originally proposed by Moore (1993) and popularized by Isenberg (2010), the core concepts underlying the entrepreneurial ecosystem are grounded in solid literature frames: the national innovation system (Freeman, 1995; Lundvall, 1992), the cluster-based theory of competitive advantage (Delgado et al., 2010; Porter, 1998), regional innovation systems (Cooke et al., 1997; Fritsch, 2001), and the national innovative capacity (Furman et al., 2002). These literatures show important conceptual and methodological differences, and they have mostly treated entrepreneurship as a factor that is peripheral to their focus of study.

Second, in a related manner, ecosystem-enhancing policies would turn sterile in the absence of social legitimacy (Lafuente et al., 2007; Feldman, 2001). The approval of the community to the adopted policies can stimulate the local entrepreneurial culture, fuel local networks, and attract more investors and entrepreneurs to the territory (Spigel, 2017).

In our sample, this is especially evident in Africa and Asia. On contrary, among European countries the configuration of the entrepreneurial ecosystem is more balanced and dominated by a large number of high-performing pillars and few lowperforming pillars. ",

In this study, two potential sources of uncertainty are analyzed: the changes in the raw data as a result of different improvement strategies of the entrepreneurial ecosystem (GEI), and the different weighting methods used to compute the countries’ CI scores. Therefore, the third robustness check analyzes the potential effect of these two factors on the interpretations of the countries’ CI scores (BOD-GEI: weights using the‘pie share’restriction, BOD-2: improvement in the two top priority pillars, and BOD-PCA: estimation using weights computed via principal components analysis). Based on the three different CI estimations, the results of this uncertainty analysis are presented in Appendix 8 (Figures A1, A2 and A3). In the figures, whisker plots show the median as well as the minimum and the maximum value of the CI scores. For interpretation purposes, an overlap of the whisker plots for a group of countries suggests that their CI scores and, consequently, their ranks are similar. On contrary, if the whisker plots for a group of countries do not overlap, then CI estimations are robust and independent of the two potential sources of uncertaintv analvzed in the studv. ",

The results indicate that the US, Denmark, Switzerland and Canada are consistently the countries with the highest CI scores. Nevertheless, there is a relatively small group of countries whose CI value is influenced by the assumptions of the BOD models: Israel, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia (Figure A1 in Appendix 8). Among top performing countries, the results in Figure A2 (Appendix 8) show that the performance of most countries in this group can be clearly distinguished, with the exception of two groups of countries with similar CI levels: Finland, Germany and Austria on the one hand; and Chile and Israel on the other hand. Finally, note that the influence of the model assumptions becomes more evident among countries with a poor performing CI (Figure A3 in Appendix 8).

Specifically, we ran different BOD-GEI specifications (Eq. (1)) using multiple weight estimation criteria in order to verify if changes in the weight intervals produce uncertain results due to rank reversal. For analytical purposes, the lower $(L_{j})$ and upper $(U_{j})$ bound of the ‘pie share’ constraint in Eq. (1) were modified to compute a new set of BOD-GEI scores using the following weight interval criteria: A) $5\\%$ $L_{j}\\,=\\,(1\\,/14)\\times\\,0.05\\wedge U_{j}\\,=$ $(1\\,/14)\\times\\,1.05$ ,B) $10\\%$ $L_{j}\\,=\\,(1\\,/14)\\times\\,0.10\\land U_{j}\\,=\\,(1\\,/14)\\times\\,1.10,\\,\\mathrm{C}$ $35\\%$ $L_{j}\\;=\\;(1\\,/14)\\times\\;0.35\\land U_{j}\\;=\\;(1\\,/14)\\times\\;1.35$ ,and D) $50\\%$ $L_{j}\\,=$ $(1\\,/14)\\times\\,0.50\\land U_{j}\\,=(1\\,/14)\\times\\,1.50$ . These weight configurations are compared to the findings obtained for the main BOD-GEI model. Results of the analysis are presented in Figure A4 of Appendix 9. Similar to the uncertainty analysis described above, the whisker plot shows the median as well as the minimum and the maximum value of the different CI scores. From Figure A4 we observe that changes in the weight intervals do not cause serious rank reversal problems. Examples of countries reporting large changes in BOD-GEI values as a result of using different weight intervals are Chile, Norway, Japan, and Singapore. These findings indicate that the proposed BOD-GEI to measure countries’entrepreneurial ecosystem are stable to different models specifications—in terms of weight intervals—which corroborates the reliability of the results presented throughout Section 4.

Instead of quantity variations and basic rankings, we show how quality improvements in this ecosystem can be realized by deploying additional resources among the policy priorities identified by the non-arbitrary, informed criteria of the BOD-GEI model. Results of the analysis connecting changes in the BOD-GEI and national outcomes validate this argument. We found a positive response by venture capitalists to quality improvements in countries′ entrepreneurial ecosystem. Macroeconomic figures, such as GDP, result from different processes carried out by multiple actors, which can explain why we did not find a convincing link between economic growth and changes in the ecosystem. The key findings clearly indicate that entrepreneurial ecosystems can eventually boost venture capitalists’activity, thus suggesting that entrepreneurship policy should be evaluated on the basis of its impact on outcomes more directly connected to entrepreneurship.

The primary policy recommendation that can be drawn from our results is clear: a tailor-made, more informed policy accounting for the properties of the local entrepreneurial ecosystem seems more appropriate than homogeneous actions based on policy isomorphism. This key aspect is connected to our first research question (how would the quality analysis of entrepreneurial ecosystems based on CIs differ when endogenous weights capturing countries' heterogeneity are included in the model?'). One of the main challenges for policy makers is to choose accurate entrepreneurship variables to generate economically meaningful policies. During the last two decades scholars have witnessed a drastic change in the way to analyze entrepreneurship at country level, which has shifted from a narrow view based on the links between business formation rates and economic figures (Naudé, 2011; Van Stel et al., 2005) towards a more holistic approach where the entrepreneurial ecosystem is at the heart of the analysis (Acs et al., 2014, 2016; Autio et al., 2015; Lafuente et al., 2020). In this sense, we argue that the many dimensions of the ecosystem included in the Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI) and its connection to economic figures validate this metric to measure entrepreneurship as a national phenomenon.

In the specific case of the BOD-GEI, the computation of endogenous (country-specific) weights can prove itself effective to identify priorities that can become the target of a more informed entrepreneurship policy (Acs et al., 2014).

Nevertheless, policy makers often lack reliable data to know how to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystem, which might translate into discretionary or ambiguous behaviors by policy makers that materialize in reforms that produce mere quantitative increases of the entrepreneurial activity with limited economic impact (Lafuente et al., 2020). The use of analytical tools—such as the proposed BOD-GEI model—has the potential to reduce the ambiguity or the discretionary behavior of policy makers, as well as to identify the specific components of the entrepreneurial ecosystem that should be prioritized in order to produce a directed policy that induces the fertilization of the entrepreneurial ecosystem with a long term perspective.

In the case the targeted outcome is the entrepreneurial ecosystem itself, we found that the effectiveness of entrepreneurship policy is conditional on the configuration of the local ecosystem. For developing countries whose ecosystem is characterized by few strong pillars, policy interventions will likely be more productive if resources are devoted to specific aspects of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. This effect is less pronounced among developed countries whose entrepreneurial ecosystem is more balanced, in terms of GEI pillars. This leads to conjecture that effective policy in these contexts might target various complementary aspects of the ecosystem (e.g., actions that enhance the interaction between economic agents and institutions) (Lafuente et al., 2020; Radosevic and Yoruk, 2013).

Venture capital boosts entrepreneurial initiatives by injecting capital and other intangibles (e.g., managerial expertise or access to networks) to new and established businesses. A solid entrepreneurial ecosystem may well be a prerequisite for the consolidation of venture capital markets; therefore, entrepreneurship policy aimed at enhancing these markets should include actions supporting different aspects of the entrepreneurial ecosystem (Bruton et al., 2005; Drover et al., 2017; Li and Zahra, 2012). Example of such policies may include, among others, the development of formal business networks, informal institutions that increase market's legitimacy and social connections between investors and entrepreneurs, as well as the promotion of knowledge transfer that facilitates the channeling of technology to entrepreneurs and established businesses.
